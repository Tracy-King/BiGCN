BiGCN
==

This is a Pytorch implementation of ***BiGCN*** model in paper:

*Predicting Emergency Medical Service Demand with Bipartite Graph Convolutional Networks*

We will open the Emergency Medical Service dataset soon afterwards.

## Requirements

(Recommend to run the model on ***Google Colaboratory***, which already contains many required libraries)

* Pytorch (1.4.0 or later)

* python 3.6

* networkx

* scikit-learn

* scipy

* keras-metrics

* geopandas

## Running



1.   Running code cell **"Environment installation & settings"** to access to your **Google Drive** and install the environment.

2.   Set the model parameters in code cell **"Global Variables & Package Import"**, and run it.

3.   Running code cell **"Read Data"** to load dataset.

4.   Running code cell **"Preprocessing"** to preprocessing dataset.

5.   Running code cell **"Function"** to set up functions used in model.

6.   Running code cell **"BiGCN Model"** to set up model.

7.   Running code cell **"Training & Testing"** to train the model, and obtain evaluation results.

8.   Change the parameters in code cell **"Global Variables & Package Import"** like Step 2, then run code cell **"Training & Testing"** for another training & evaluation.
